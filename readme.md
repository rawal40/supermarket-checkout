## Impact Interview Exercise

**Implement the code for a checkout system that handles pricing schemes such as “apples cost 50p each or three apples cost 130p”.**

Implement the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items. In a normal supermarket, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units (or SKUs). 

In our store, we’ll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C and so on..). Our goods are priced individually.

In addition, some items are multi-priced: buy N of them, and they’ll cost you Y pence.

For example, item ‘A’ might cost 50p individually, but this week we have a special offer: buy three A’s and they’ll cost you 130p. The prices are:

| SKU | Unit Price | Special Price  |
|-----|------------|----------------|
|  A  |     50     | 3 for 130      |
|-----|------------|----------------|
|  B  |     30     | 2 for 45       |
|-----|------------|----------------|
|  C  |     20     | 2 for 38       |
|     |            | 3 for 50       | 
|-----|------------|----------------|
|  D  |     15     | 5 if purchased |
|     |            |  with an ‘A’   |
|-----|------------|----------------|
|  E  |     5      |                |
|-----|------------|----------------|

The checkout should accept the items in any order, so that if we scan a B, an A and another B, it’ll recognize the two B’s and price them at 45p (for a total price of 95p).

The pricing rules change frequently, bear this in mind with your implementation.

The interface to the checkout should be:

    interface CheckoutInterface
    {
        /**
         * Adds an item to the checkout
         *
         * @param $sku string
         */
        public function scan(string $sku);
        
        /**
         * Calculates the total price of all items in this checkout
         *
         * @return int
         */
        public function total(): int;
    }
